# Interpreting Answers to Yes-No Questions in Dialogues from Multiple Domains

The repository for NAACL 2024 finding paper [Interpreting Answers to Yes-No Questions in Dialogues from Multiple Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16262).
In this work, we developed so far the largest yes-no question dataset from eight dialogue domains in English. 
We propose an approach grounded by distant supervision to interpret indirect answers to yes-no questions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method works on new domains without requiring substantial human involvement in annotation.


# Dataset 

We collect yes-no questions from existing dialogue datasets for two tasks: (1) Identifying yes-no questions from dialogue, and (2) Interpreting indirect answers to yes-no questions.
The datasets are available on Google Drive. You can download the data with the [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XOzqwSwFuPD0iC9pyez8k04vqb6EDGwg?usp=sharing).

## Dataset to identify yes-no questions

The yes-no questions are collected (by rules and a trained classifier) from five dialogue datasets: SWDA, MRDA, DailyDialog, Friends, and MWOZ. 



#### Dataset Statistics:
|                      | SWDA | MRDA | DailyDialog | Friends | MWOZ    |
|------------------:   | -----:| ---:|  ------:    |  ------:|  ------:| 
| # yes-no questions   | 3.7k | 2.8k | 13.5k       | 4.9k    | 59.4k   | 

#### Dataset Fields

* ```Question:``` The yes-no question that is identified from dialogue.
* ```Answer:``` The answer to the yes-no question (the turn immediately after the question turn).


 

## Dataset to interpret indirect answers
We collect yes-no questions from three dialogue domains (by a trained classifier): movie script, tennis interview, and task-oriented dialogues related to travel booking. 



#### Dataset Statistics:


|                      | Movie | Tennis | Air     | 
|------------------:   | -----:| ------:|  ------:| 
| # training instance  | 6,250 | 19,055 | 355,549 | 
| # validation instance|    60 |  60    |  60     | 
| # test instance      |   240 | 240    | 240     | 




#### Dataset Fields

* ```pre_sent_n:``` dialogue turn before the yes-no question. 4 turns (from pre_sent_1 to pre_sent_4) are included.
* ```Q:``` The yes-no question.
* ```A:``` The answer to the yes-no question (the turn immediately after the question turn).
* ```after_sent_n:``` dialogue turn after the answer to yes-no question. 4 turns (from aft_sent_1 to aft_sent_4) are included.
* ```label:``` The interpretation of the answer. For answers in the training dataset, the interpretation is obtained by the polar keywords and thus can only be ```yes``` or ```no```. For answers in the benchmark dataset, the interpretation is made by human annotators and can be ```yes```, ```no``` or ```middle (neither yes nor no)```.

    abstract = "Yes-no questions expect a yes or no for an answer, but people often skip polar keywords. Instead, they answer with long explanations that must be interpreted. In this paper, we focus on this challenging problem and release new benchmarks in eight languages. We present a distant supervision approach to collect training data, and demonstrate that direct answers (i.e., with polar keywords) are useful to train models to interpret indirect answers (i.e., without polar keywords). We show that monolingual fine-tuning is beneficial if training data can be obtained via distant supervision for the language of interest (5 languages). Additionally, we show that cross-lingual fine-tuning is always beneficial (8 languages).",
